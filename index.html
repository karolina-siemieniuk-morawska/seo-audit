        <p class="small_title">
          Without proper optimisation, your website will seriously struggle to
          rank highly on Google.
        </p>
        <p>
          Many business owners wonder why their website isn't showing up on
          Google search results and want to know what it takes to get
          visibility. If you are not aware of how the ranking process works,
          Google has its own set of ever-changing rules that your website must
          adhere to. An algorithm takes into consideration how well your website
          sticks to these rules, and then assigns it a score. That score then
          determines how highly your website ranks on the search engine.
        </p>

        <div class="important_info">
          <p>
            If you want your website to rank highly on Google, you need to make
            sure it's adhering to the ranking criteria and scoring well.
          </p>
          <p>
            That's why an SEO audit is so important - it'll help you identify
            where your website is missing the mark, and allow you to make the
            necessary changes to:

            <p class="icon_description">
              Achieve better rankings,

            <p class="icon_description">
              Help visitors to more easily navigate your site (that's right, we
              don't just optimise for Google's robots),
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="icon_box">
            <img src="./assets/icon-3-bulb.jpg" alt="lightbulb" />
            <p class="icon_description">
              Avoid getting penalised by Google.

        <p>
          An SEO audit will make sure your website is running according to
          Google's standards, not experiencing any issues, and on its way to
          high rankings. Thats why you can focus on making other important
          business decisions in the meantime.

            rundown:

          <ul>
            <li>
              Identifying & correcting technical issues such as meta titles,
              descriptions, headings, and so on;
            </li>
            <li>Creating internal links;</li>
            <li>
              Assessing on-site content and ensuring it adheres to Google

            </li>
            <li>Working with redirects;</li>
            <li>
              Competitor analysis, comparing your website to that of your

            </li>
            <li>
              Other SEO elements like implementing a sitemap, hreflang tag,
              submitting your website to the google search Console, installing

            </li>

          <p>
            As I mentioned before, I'm not just about optimising your website
            for Google's robots. My main focus is always the
            <em>user expeience</em>, and all of the changes I make to your
            website will be with that in mind. I will ensure your website is
            easy for users to navigate, convinces them to utilise your services,
            and encourages them to visit again.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div></div>
        <div>
          <p>
            Even if you running killer marketing campaigns, if your website
            isn't optimised and running smoothly then you'll suffer setbacks.
            Having an SEO audit performed on your site will allow you to have
            one less thing on your mind, so you can focus on creating more
            campaigns and leading more visitors to your site.
          </p>
