              Without proper optimisation, your website will seriously struggle
              to rank highly on Google.
            </p>
            <p>
              Many business owners wonder why their website isn't showing up on
              Google search results and want to know what it takes to get
              visibility. If you are not aware of how the ranking process works,
              Google has its own set of ever-changing rules that your website
              must adhere to. An algorithm takes into consideration how well
              your website sticks to these rules, and then assigns it a score.
              That score then determines how highly your website ranks on the
              search engine.

              If you want your website to rank highly on Google, you need to make sure
              it's adhering to the ranking criteria and scoring well.
            </p>
            <p>
              That's why an SEO audit is so important - it'll help you identify where
              your website is missing the mark, and allow you to make the necessary
              changes to:

            An SEO audit will make sure your website is running according to Google's
            standards, not experiencing any issues, and on its way to high rankings.
            Thats why you can focus on making other important business decisions in the
            meantime.
