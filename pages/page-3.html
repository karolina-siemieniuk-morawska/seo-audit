        <p class="small_title">
          You’ve been penalised by Google, now what?
        </p>

        <p>
          If your website has experienced a sudden drop in traffic and you’re
          not sure what the reason is, it’s highly possible that you’ve been
          penalised by Google. There are two major types of penalties that
          Google imposes on websites:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Filter</b> - When you’ve received a filter penalty, your website
            rankings will drop dramatically, and
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Ban</b> - When your website is banned, it completely disappears
            from Google’s search results. And that’s no good at all.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          <b>Why have I been penalised?</b>
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="important_info">
        <p>
          Google penalises websites when they go against its guidelines. A
          common reason could be that your website has been hacked, you or your
          competitors have done some kind of link building, or you’ve made
          recent changes to your site that aren’t in line with Google’s
          guidelines. These guidelines are an important set of rules that
          outline what you can or can’t do to make your website rank on Google’s
          organic search results. If you try to get your website to rank by
          using the wrong strategies, then you’re likely to be penalised.
