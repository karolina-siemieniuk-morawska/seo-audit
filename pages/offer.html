                I can help you prepare a list of questions to send to the

                accuracy of their results. This can help determine how trusty or
                reliable the previous website owner is,

                I’ll scan the website for any technical issues, check the
                history of the domain for any unusual activity, and do a rigid
                check of the entire service (this bit is boring so I’ll save you

                I’ve purchased a lot of websites in the past, and I know what

                you throughout the entire process from beginning to end,
                ensuring that you purchase the rights to the entire website and
                its texts, images, and so on, and I’ll make sure you close the
